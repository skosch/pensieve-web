Events and reminders

Thought should show up on the dashboard during a certain date range.

{Aug1} -> next august 1, midnight to midnight

Start a reminder two days before

{Aug 1, 2018 10am-12pm !2 weeks} -> {
  reminder: "2018-07-15 10:00",
  start_date: "2018-08-01 10:00",
  end_date: "2018-08-01 12:00",
}

{RANGE} -> Show in calendar, no reminder
{RANGE R REPEAT !4 days} -> Set event range, set repeat, set reminder 4 days before the start point of every repeat
